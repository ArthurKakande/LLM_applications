              "AIMessage(content=\"Low latency is crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) because it directly impacts the user experience, model performance, and overall efficiency of language-based applications. Here are some reasons why low latency is essential for LLMs:\\n\\n1. **Real-time Interaction**: LLMs are often used in applications that require real-time interaction, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation systems. Low latency ensures that the model responds quickly to user input, providing a seamless and engaging experience.\\n2. **Conversational Flow**: In conversational AI, latency can disrupt the natural flow of conversation. High latency can lead to awkward pauses, making the interaction feel unnatural and frustrating. Low latency helps maintain a smooth conversation, allowing users to engage more naturally with the model.\\n3. **Model Performance**: LLMs rely on complex algorithms and massive datasets to generate responses. High latency can lead to increased computational overhead, which can negatively impact model performance, accuracy, and reliability. Low latency enables the model to process requests efficiently, reducing the risk of errors and inaccuracies.\\n4. **Scalability**: As the number of users and requests increases, high latency can become a bottleneck, limiting the scalability of LLM-based applications. Low latency enables the model to handle a higher volume of requests, making it more suitable for large-scale deployments.\\n5. **User Experience**: High latency can lead to user frustration, abandonment, and a negative overall experience. Low latency ensures that users receive prompt responses, which is essential for building trust, satisfaction, and loyalty.\\n6. **Competitive Advantage**: In today's fast-paced digital landscape, low latency can be a key differentiator for LLM-based applications. By providing rapid responses, businesses can gain a competitive edge, attract more users, and drive revenue growth.\\n7. **Edge Computing**: With the increasing adoption of edge computing, low latency is critical for LLMs to process data closer to the user, reducing latency and improving real-time processing capabilities.\\n8. **Safety-Critical Applications**: In safety-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles or medical diagnosis, high latency can have severe consequences. Low latency ensures that LLMs provide timely and accurate responses, which is essential for making critical decisions.\\n9. **Cost Savings**: High latency can result in increased infrastructure costs, as more resources are required to handle the increased computational overhead. Low latency helps reduce infrastructure costs, making LLM-based applications more cost-effective.\\n10. **Future-Proofing**: As LLMs continue to evolve and become more pervasive, low latency will become even more critical. By prioritizing low latency today, developers can future-proof their applications and ensure they remain competitive in the long run.\\n\\nIn summary, low latency is vital for LLMs to provide a seamless user experience, maintain model performance, and ensure scalability, competitiveness, and cost-effectiveness. By prioritizing low latency, developers can unlock the full potential of LLMs and create innovative applications that transform industries and improve lives.\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 605, 'prompt_tokens': 33, 'total_tokens': 638, 'completion_time': 1.728571429, 'prompt_time': 0.007533006, 'queue_time': None, 'total_time': 1.7361044350000001}, 'model_name': 'llama3-70b-8192', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_87cbfbbc4d', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-1c017f40-0e89-46d0-891a-dc2e5532134a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 33, 'output_tokens': 605, 'total_tokens': 638})"

There are notable differences \\nin understanding TFGBV across demographics, especially among males aged 25-34, indicating a need for better \\neducation and outreach. Content creators demonstrate a nuanced understanding of TFGBV, recognizing various \\nforms such as online harassment, doxxing, cyberbullying, and stalking, with Instagram and TikTok deemed safer \\nthan X, formerly T witter, which faces issues like organized cyber mobs and fewer safeguards.\\nWomen bear the brunt of TFGBV, leading to significant emotional and psychological tolls, often resulting in the \\nabandonment of public-facing ambitions and roles, especially on X.

Lowest TFGBV Awareness Among Males 18-24 years\\nAmong the various types of TFGBV mentioned in the online survey, online harassment emerged as the most \\nrecognized form among respondents while stalking, doxxing, cyber mobbing, impersonation, and defamation, \\nwere generally less known. The results underscore the importance of raising awareness and providing education on \\nthe various manifestations of TFGBV beyond just online harassment. \\nThe respondents were tested to see their opinion on the difference between TFGBV and Physical GBV. The \\nrespondents were asked for their opinions on the distinction between TFGBV and physical GBV to assess their \\nawareness levels. 60% of female respondents recognized a clear difference between the two, indicating their \\nunderstanding of these nuanced distinctions. Conversely, male respondents, particularly those aged 18 to 24, did \\nnot perceive a differentiation, viewing both forms of GBV as harmful to women—physical GBV causing bodily \\nharm and TFGBV resulting in emotional and mental distress. Overall, there was an almost equal split among \\nrespondents, with a slight majority acknowledging the difference. A notable difference in perception was observed \\nbetween male and female respondents.\\nFigure 6. Is TFGBV different from Physical GBV?\\nRespondents highlighted that TFGBV differs from physical GBV in scale, visibility, reach, and impact, particularly \\nemphasizing its severe emotional and psychological effects.
